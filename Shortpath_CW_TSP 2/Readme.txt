Go to the Main.java

1.Select Algorithm but default setting is Clarke and Wright.
if we want to run TSP there is a TSP gate so uncomment TSP.

2.Check the data sets in folder Data.
 Select the data sets and put a data name into the path
for example we select trydata.txt so we we put in the path down below.
// Data path
        File myFile = new File("Data/trydata.txt");
3.Key in truck capacity  the Main Class, and in Algorithm Class.

4. Press Run

Change trucks capacity as following

P-n16-k8    truck capacity =  30
E-n22-k4    truck capacity =  23
E-n101-k14  truck capacity =  35
A-n63-k10   truck capacity =  100
E-n33-k4    truck capacity =  8000
P-n22-k8    truck capacity =  3000
A-n61-k9    truck capacity =  100
X-n125-k30  truck capacity =  188
X-n148-k46  truck capacity =  18
X-n200-k36  truck capacity =  402
X-n266-k58  truck capacity =  35
X-n289-k60  truck capacity =  267
X-n420-k130 truck capacity =  18
X-n524-k153 truck capacity =  125
X-n856-k95  truck capacity =  9
X-n1001-k43 truck capacity =  131
